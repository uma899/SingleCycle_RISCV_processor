# SingleCycle_RISCV_processor
This aims to act like a real world computer processor with fewer instruction set.

### Still Under development
At present, it is able to get upto 8 instructions (in binary format using RISC V instruction set) from a text file.
Only R type inst. are possible for now. And loading data from memory is working
